 PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) – 


In Kubernetes, if a pod restarts or moves to another node, its data usually gets lost. To solve this, Kubernetes provides a way to store data permanently using Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).

## PersistentVolume (PV)
A PersistentVolume is a piece of storage in the cluster that’s been provisioned by an admin or dynamically created.

It’s a resource in the cluster, just like a node is.

It represents actual storage from local disks, NFS, cloud storage, etc.

PVs are defined and managed independently of pods.

## PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
A PersistentVolumeClaim is a request for storage made by a user (or pod).

It asks for a specific amount of storage and access mode (like read/write).

When a PVC is created, Kubernetes tries to bind it to a suitable PV.

Once bound, the pod can use that volume to store and access data permanently.

## How They Work Together
Admin sets up a PV.

User (or pod) creates a PVC asking for storage.

Kubernetes matches the PVC with a PV.

The pod uses that volume and data remains even if the pod restarts.
